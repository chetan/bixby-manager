#
# When using the partial via @include_partial, the template will be wrapped in
# a span with a unique ID unless the first element is a TR or @wrap == false.
#
# This is necessary to locate and properly bind events in the resulting document,
# once everything has been rendered (e.g., once the parent view finishes rendering).
